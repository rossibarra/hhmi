\title{Differentiating Work from Prior Mentors}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent None of my graduate advisors (Ellstrand, G\'{o}mez-Pompa, Hamrick) work with genome-scale sequencing or genotyping data, and none focus on population genetics.\\

\noindent My postdoctoral advisor (Gaut) worked on maize evolutionary genetics earlier in his career, and we continue to collaborate with him.
In the last 6 years, however, much of his work has focused on experimental evolution in \emph{E. coli} and the evolution of gene regulation, epigenetics, and transposable elements in \emph{Arabidopsis} and rice.
