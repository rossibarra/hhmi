\title{Current Collaborative Network}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent My current collaborative efforts include leading an investigation of highland adaptation (4 labs) and participating in research into the biology of rare alleles (8 labs) and the functional genomics of centromeres (5 labs). 
My group generally leads population genetic analyses, as well as sequencing efforts (from PacBio to \emph{de novo} assembly to resequencing) and has played a central role in designing and writing proposals for funding. We are responsible for analyses ranging from copy number variation to genotype imputation, evaluation of demography and selection and estimation of recombination rates.
