\section*{Maize as a model for complex genomes}

Genome size variation in plants, humans. 
Differences in large complex genomes -- Fraser \citep{fraser2013gene} vs. \citep{pyhajarvi2013complex} or \citep{hancock2011adaptation}

\section*{Notes}

\citep{peischl2015expansion} predict more u-shaped SFS in expanded pops, also more homozygous deleterious. this is seen in humans. Li's results in maize

\citep{fu2014characteristics}
``Indeed, a substantial amount of the higher density of deleterious alleles in EA individuals in the simulated data is attributable to weakly deleterious mutations $(|s| \approx 10^{-4})$''

\citep{balick2013response} show weighted sum of the SFS can be used to differentiate recessive vs. not at deeteirous sites.

\citep{lohmueller2014impact} 
``Under a model where a mutation's effect on a trait is correlated with its effect on fitness, rare variants explain a greater portion of the additive genetic variance of the trait in a population that has recently expanded than in a population that did not recently expand. Further, when using a single-marker test, for a given false-positive rate and sample size, recent population growth decreases the expected number of significant associations with the trait relative to the number detected in a population that did not expand. However, in a model where there is no correlation between a mutation's effect on fitness and the effect on the trait, common variants account for much of the additive genetic variance, regardless of demography.''

\citep{tennessen2012evolution} Shows vast majority of functionally important alleles rare, attributes to explosive population growth and weak purifying selection
